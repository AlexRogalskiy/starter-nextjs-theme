This is a production-ready project built with Next.js and Tailwind, equipped with visual editing capabilities using Stackbit. It uses markdown files as the content source.

⚡ Demo: [starter-nextjs.stackbit.app](https://starter-nextjs.stackbit.app/)

## Quickstart

⚠️ If you plan to use this project as a starting point for a real website, we suggest you [start locally](#local-development).

Otherwise, to quickly see this project in action, [create a new Stackbit project from this repo](https://docs.stackbit.com/how-to-guides/import/#duplicate_a_repository):

1. Visit https://app.stackbit.com/import
1. Chose **Duplicate a repository** and click **Next**.
1. Add and validate https://github.com/stackbit-themes/starter-nextjs-theme/ as the repository, then click **Next**.
1. Click **Create Project**.

If creating initially with Stackbit, you'll have to [transfer the repo to your GitHub account](https://docs.stackbit.com/how-to-guides/local-development/transfer-repo/) if you wish to work locally.

## Local Development

The typical development process is to begin by working locally.

Clone the repository:

```txt
git clone https://github.com/stackbit-themes/starter-nextjs-theme.git my-stackbit-site
```

Install the dependencies:

```txt
cd my-stackbit-site
npm install
```

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
npm run dev
```

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project.
