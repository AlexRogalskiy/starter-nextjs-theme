# Full Stackbit Starter

![Full Stackbit Starter](https://assets.stackbit.com/docs/full-starter-thumb.png)

This is a production-ready project built with Next.js and Tailwind, equipped with visual editing capabilities using Stackbit.

âš¡ Demo: [starter-nextjs.stackbit.app](https://starter-nextjs.stackbit.app/)

## Quickstart

To create a new Stackbit project, visit [jamstack.new](https://jamstack.new/) and choose "Full Starter" as your project.

Stackbit will clone the repository on your behalf (which you [can transfer to your account](https://docs.stackbit.com/how-to-guides/local-development/transfer-repo/)) and deploy the site to production.

## Setup (Local Development)

To work more immediately with the code, you can begin by working locally.

Clone the repository:

```txt
git clone https://github.com/stackbit-themes/starter-nextjs-theme.git my-stackbit-site
```

Install the dependencies:

```txt
cd my-stackbit-site
npm install
```

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
npm run dev
```

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project.
